1.  Google Map based project in which  we can track multiple devices from using your device.Use case- In families it can be used 
    to track family person on the way. Or can be used by parent to track on child positions.
2.  sfGame like angry bird in which things can be thrown using rubber band to throw the things on the enemy to destroy them and win the game.
